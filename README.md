#### Technically focused individual in the Greater Cleveland Area :earth_americas: working to learn the technical skills:books: needed to start a career in Data Analytics.

I've gotten a taste of data analytics between past educational and professional experience including using **MATlab** to process experiment data at an internship while attending *University of Washington* :school: and handling analytics in **Excel** for my team during my time at *Zulily* :office:. I've come to realize that a career in data analytics is a great way to utilize the Critical Thinking approach I gained getting a Dual Mathematics and Physics degree but that I still have a long way to go regarding learning technologies used in the field.

*Looking to use this site to start learning the tools used in data science while recording related projects as well as the occasional passion project.*
